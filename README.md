I’m an Software Engineering Intern who goes on a path to be a skillful and expert software engineer. I’m a quick learner and a good team player. I always try to have a good time and task management and deliver customers the best problem-solving service rather than delivering just what they asked.

Skills : 

Java and MySQL are my best skills, and I did commercial projects using them, so I have a wonderful experience with them. And also I’m skilled in web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Also, I’m very good at UI/UX and my actual project interfaces can be seen in my portfolio. 

Experience :

I already worked for a software company as a software developer and finished projects received from them. Also, I have done Arduino projects for the university. (It can be seen in my GitHub account). 

I currently work as a SOftware Engineering Intern at Wiley Sri Lanka.
